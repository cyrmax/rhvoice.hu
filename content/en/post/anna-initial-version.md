We are pleased to present the first initial version of a new Hungarian voice for RHVoice named Anna.

This voice was trained from the same open source data set used for the Piper TTS Anna Hungarian voice.

The voice has a very soft and monotonous sound; some users consider this voice ideal for reading books.

Unfortunately, the dataset is missing some phonemes, so the voice will not have better quality in terms of pronunciation.
