We are pleased to present Imre, the first male Hungarian voice for the RHVoice speech synthesizer.

Imre was trained from a Piper TTS dataset, just like the already well-known Anna.

Fun fact: When we just started the Hungarian RHVoice project, we were thinking about which open source datasets to use, and of course Piper TTS datasets were the first on our checklist.
When we started, we thought that the Berta dataset was the best and that we wouldn't get any valuable results from Anna and Imre because of their low quality.
But now, as you can see, we already have Anna and now we present you Imre.
Of course, we also tried to do something with Berta's dataset, but the results were so bad that we even decided not to publish it.
