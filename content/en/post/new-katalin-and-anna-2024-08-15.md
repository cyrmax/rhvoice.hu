These new versions of Anna and Katalin Hungarian RHVoice voices have only one but very important new feature.
We have implemented correct reading of decimal numbers like 1.5, 0.42, ETC.

Kirill Belousov, who implemented this feature from scrach, says

> I won't say that it was the hardest task in my life, but it was hard enough to spend several days and get a headache implementing this feature.
> The biggest problem is that no other language in RHVoice can read decimal numbers in such an advanced way and I had no reference, no idea where to start.
> But finally this feature is done and Hungarian users will be the first to try it.
> If this challenging experiment succeeds, I will probably try to implement the same for English and Russian voices as well.

## How to test

As this feature is completely new in RHVoice, it needs lots of testing.

If you find some decimal numbers that are pronounced incorrectly, please copy the entire sentence with the incorrect number and tell us about the error.

You can always contact us via email [info@rhvoice.hu](mailto:info@rhvoice.hu).

When reporting, please tell us the following:

1. Which operating system you are experiencing the problem on (NVDA, JAWS, SAPI, Android);
2. What RHVoice is actually saying, what you are hearing;
3. What should be pronounced, how it should be pronounced correctly;
4. Which RHVoice voice is causing the problem.
