Hello, dear users!

With this short update, we want to let you know that we are still here, alive, and continuing the development of Hungarian RHVoice voices.

## Katalin is Being Improved

We know that Katalin is one of your favorite Hungarian voices.  
We love this voice too, and we are currently working hard to make it even better.  
We are cleaning the audio dataset, fixing transcription issues, and experimenting with new training algorithms to achieve better sound quality and perfect pronunciation in all cases.

## Language Module Enhancements

In parallel with the improvements to Katalin, we are also adding new features and fixing errors in the Hungarian language module itself.  
Currently, we are working on adding support for reading ordinal numbers and correcting the pronunciation of certain letters.  
In future versions, all voices are likely to have more distinct differences in the pronunciation of short and long vowels.

## Changes in Our Team

Unfortunately, this update does not bring only positive news.  
Due to personal disagreements among team members, Nikolett Till is leaving us.  
As she was our only native Hungarian speaker, all translations on the website will now be handled by artificial intelligence until we find a suitable replacement.

## The Website is at Risk

Since Nikolett is the only Hungarian citizen on the team, she formally owns the RHVoice.hu domain name.  
If she refuses to transfer the domain to another person, stops paying for it, or disrupts its settings in any way, the website may no longer be accessible.

In case of such an issue, we will launch several mirrors of the website.  
One mirror will be hosted at [RHVoice-hu.cyrmax.ru](https://rhvoice-hu.cyrmax.ru), and another will be available on GitHub Pages.
