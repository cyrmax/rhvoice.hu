New versions of Katalin and Anna Hungarian voices for RHVoice are available for our users.

These versions are built with a new RHVoice core that includes important fixes for JAWS users.
JAWS should now read emojis correctly.

We have also corrected the pronunciation of all abbreviations ending with the letter "s" in these new Hungarian voices.
Say goodbye to strange reading of "https" and "ftps".

## Notice for Android users

For new versions of voices to work on Android you will need a new version of Android application.
You can find the latest version on [voices page]({{<relref "voices">}}) or on a corresponding news page for Android application.
