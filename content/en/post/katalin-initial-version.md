We are pleased to present the first initial version of a new Hungarian voice for RHVoice named Katalin.

This voice was trained using an open source dataset found on Kaggle.
We thank Dia for reading 4515 sentences from the book Egri Csillagok.

The source of the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/hungarian-single-speaker-speech-dataset).

Katalin sounds clearer, more expressive and probably more aggressive than Anna, and in our opinion is better for everyday tasks such as using with a screen reader on desktop and mobile devices.
