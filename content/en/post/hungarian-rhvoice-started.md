Two weeks ago, our team presented the first beta versions of two new Hungarian voices: Anna and Katalin.

The presentation was very amateurish, we just wrote a post in several Hungarian Facebook communities related to visually impaired users.
We provided some very strange and unmemorable links and very short instructions.
And of course we realized that this was not the best way to deliver new versions and tutorials.

So that's why this website was created.

We thank Kirill Belousov for creating and maintaining this website and Till Nikolett for translating the texts into Hungarian.
